* Try using ConfigObj
  - http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/configobj.shtml
  - Some changes: s/:/=/; diff in use of parser obj/config obj
  - *Hoping* that validation will pay off -- the configspec.ini seems
    particularly nice.
* Ingred parsing
  - I *believe* we can get rid of the checking for syntax; this should
    be handled by configobj.
* Hop parsing
  - How to handle the "name - time" part of things?
